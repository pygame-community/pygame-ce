class Surface:
    """Pygame object for representing images.

    A pygame Surface is used to represent any image. The Surface has a fixed
    resolution and pixel format. Surfaces with 8-bit pixels use a color palette
    to map to 24-bit color.

    Call :meth:`pygame.Surface()` to create a new image object. The Surface will
    be cleared to all black. The only required arguments are the sizes. With no
    additional arguments, the Surface will be created in a format that best
    matches the display Surface.

    The pixel format can be controlled by passing the bit depth or an existing
    Surface. The flags argument is a bitmask of additional features for the
    surface. You can pass any combination of these flags:

    ::

        HWSURFACE    (obsolete in pygame 2) creates the image in video memory
        SRCALPHA     the pixel format will include a per-pixel alpha

    Both flags are only a request, and may not be possible for all displays and
    formats.

    Advanced users can combine a set of bitmasks with a depth value. The masks
    are a set of 4 integers representing which bits in a pixel will represent
    each color. Normal Surfaces should not require the masks argument.

    Surfaces can have many extra attributes like alpha planes, colorkeys, source
    rectangle clipping. These functions mainly effect how the Surface is blitted
    to other Surfaces. The blit routines will attempt to use hardware
    acceleration when possible, otherwise they will use highly optimized
    software blitting methods.

    There are three types of transparency supported in pygame: colorkeys,
    surface alphas, and pixel alphas. Surface alphas can be mixed with
    colorkeys, but an image with per pixel alphas cannot use the other modes.
    Colorkey transparency makes a single color value transparent. Any pixels
    matching the colorkey will not be drawn. The surface alpha value is a single
    value that changes the transparency for the entire image. A surface alpha of
    255 is opaque, and a value of 0 is completely transparent.

    Per pixel alphas are different because they store a transparency value for
    every pixel. This allows for the most precise transparency effects, but it
    also the slowest. Per pixel alphas cannot be mixed with surface alpha and
    colorkeys.

    There is support for pixel access for the Surfaces. Pixel access on hardware
    surfaces is slow and not recommended. Pixels can be accessed using the
    :meth:`get_at()` and :meth:`set_at()` functions. These methods are fine for
    simple access, but will be considerably slow when doing of pixel work with
    them. If you plan on doing a lot of pixel level work, it is recommended to
    use a :class:`pygame.PixelArray`, which gives an array like view of the
    surface. For involved mathematical manipulations try the
    :mod:`pygame.surfarray` module (It's quite quick, but requires NumPy.)

    Any functions that directly access a surface's pixel data will need that
    surface to be lock()'ed. These functions can :meth:`lock()` and
    :meth:`unlock()` the surfaces themselves without assistance. But, if a
    function will be called many times, there will be a lot of overhead for
    multiple locking and unlocking of the surface. It is best to lock the
    surface manually before making the function call many times, and then
    unlocking when you are finished. All functions that need a locked surface
    will say so in their docs. Remember to leave the Surface locked only while
    necessary.

    Surface pixels are stored internally as a single number that has all the
    colors encoded into it. Use the :meth:`map_rgb()` and
    :meth:`unmap_rgb()` to convert between individual red, green, and blue
    values into a packed integer for that Surface.

    Surfaces can also reference sections of other Surfaces. These are created
    with the :meth:`subsurface()` method. Any change to either Surface will
    effect the other.

    Each Surface contains a clipping area. By default the clip area covers the
    entire Surface. If it is changed, all drawing operations will only effect
    the smaller area.

        Draws another Surface onto this Surface.

        **Parameters**
            - ``source``
                The ``Surface`` object to draw onto this ``Surface``.
                If it has transparency, transparent pixels will be ignored when blittting to an 8-bit ``Surface``.
            - ``dest`` *(optional)*
                The ``source`` draw position onto this ``Surface``, defaults to (0, 0).
                It can be a coordinate pair ``(x, y)`` or a ``Rect`` (using its top-left corner).
                If a ``Rect`` is passed, its size will not affect the blit.
            - ``area`` *(optional)*
                The rectangular portion of the ``source`` to draw.
                It can be a ``Rect`` object representing that section. If ``None`` or not provided,
                the entire source surface will be drawn.
                If the ``Rect`` has negative position, the final blit position will be
                ``dest`` - ``Rect.topleft``.
            - ``special_flags`` *(optional)*
                Controls how the colors of the ``source`` are combined with this Surface.
                If not provided it defaults to ``BLENDMODE_NONE`` (``0``).
                See :doc:`special_flags_list` for a list of possible values.
        **Return**
            A :doc:`rect` object representing the affected area of this ``Surface`` that was modified
            by the blit operation. This area includes only the pixels within this ``Surface`` or
            its clipping area (see :meth:`set_clip`).
            Generally you don't need to use this return value, as it was initially designed to
            pass it to :meth:`pygame.display.update` to optimize the updating of the display.
            Since modern computers are fast enough to update the entire display at high speeds,
            this return value is rarely used nowadays.

              may appear slightly different compared to a non-self blit.

            - The blit is ignored if the ``source`` is positioned completely outside this ``Surface``'s
              clipping area. Otherwise only the overlapping area will be drawn.

            - To draw a ``Surface`` with a special flag, you must specify an area as well, e.g.,
              ``(source, dest, None, special_flags)``.

            - Prefer using :meth:`blits` over :meth:`blit` when drawing multiple surfaces
              for better performance. Use :meth:`blit` if you need to draw a single surface.

            - For drawing a sequence of (source, dest) pairs with whole source Surface
              and a singular special_flag, use the :meth:`fblits()` method.

        easier to work with the BLEND_PREMULTIPLED blend mode flag of the blit()
        method. Surfaces which have called this method will only look correct
        after blitting if the BLEND_PREMULTIPLED special flag is used.

        It is worth noting that after calling this method, methods that return the
        color of a pixel such as get_at() will return the alpha multiplied color
        values. It is not possible to fully reverse an alpha multiplication of
        the colors in a surface as integer color channel data is generally
        reduced by the operation (e.g. 255 x 0 = 0, from there it is not
        possible to reconstruct the original 255 from just the two remaining
        zeros in the color and alpha channels).

        If you call this method, and then call it again, it will multiply the color
        channels by the alpha channel twice. There are many possible ways to obtain
        a surface with the color channels pre-multiplied by the alpha channel in
        pygame, and it is not possible to tell the difference just from the
        information in the pixels. It is completely possible to have two identical
        surfaces - one intended for pre-multiplied alpha blending and one intended
        for normal blending. For this reason we do not store state on surfaces
        intended for pre-multiplied alpha blending.

        Surfaces without an alpha channel cannot use this method and will return
        an error if you use it on them. It is best used on 32 bit surfaces (the
        default on most platforms) as the blitting on these surfaces can be
        accelerated by SIMD versions of the pre-multiplied blitter.

        In general pre-multiplied alpha blitting is faster then 'straight alpha'
        blitting and produces superior results when blitting an alpha surface onto
        another surface with alpha - assuming both surfaces contain pre-multiplied
        alpha colors.
