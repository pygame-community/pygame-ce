# this workflow tests sdist builds and also doubles as a way to test that
# pygame compiles on all ubuntu LTS versions
# the main difference between this and the manylinux builds is that this runs
# directly under ubuntu and uses apt installed dependencies, while the
# manylinux workflow runs with centos docker and self-compiled dependencies
# IMPORTANT: binaries are not to be uploaded from this workflow!
