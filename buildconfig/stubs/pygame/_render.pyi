"""Experimental pygame module porting the SDL render video system

The SDL render video system supports both software and GPU-accelerated
rendering through the Renderer, Texture and Image objects.

=====================

.. warning::
   This module isn't ready for prime time yet, it's still in development.
   These docs are primarily meant to help the pygame developers and
   super-early adopters who are in communication with the developers.
   This API will change.

   Also, this module is a C implementation of most of the features of the
   sdl2_video module. It is currently incomplete.

    """Object wrapping a 2D rendering context for a window

    :class:`Renderer` objects provide a cross-platform API for rendering 2D
    graphics onto a :class:`Window`, by using either Metal (macOS), OpenGL
    (macOS, Windows, Linux) or Direct3D (Windows) rendering drivers, depending
    on what is set or is available on a system during their creation.

    They can be used to draw both :class:`Texture` objects and simple points,
    lines and rectangles (which are colored based on :attr:`Renderer.draw_color`).

    If configured correctly and supported by an underlying rendering driver, Renderer
    objects can have a :class:`Texture` object temporarily set as a target texture
    (the Texture object must have been created with target texture usage support),
    which allows those textures to be drawn onto.

    To present drawn content onto the window, :meth:`Renderer.present` should be
    called. :meth:`Renderer.clear` should be called to clear any drawn content
    with the set Renderer draw color.

    When things are drawn onto Renderer objects, an internal batching system is
    used by default to batch those "draw calls" together, to have all of them be
    processed in one go when :meth:`Renderer.present` is called. This is unlike
    :class:`pygame.Surface` objects, on which modifications via blitting occur
    immediately, but lends well to the behavior of GPUs, as draw calls can be
    expensive on lower-end models.
