"""Pygame module to control the display window and screen.

This module offers control over the pygame display. Pygame has a single display
Surface that is either contained in a window or runs full screen. Once you
create the display you treat it as a regular Surface. Changes are not
immediately visible onscreen; you must choose one of the two flipping functions
to update the actual display.

The origin of the display, where x = 0 and y = 0, is the top left of the
screen. Both axes increase positively towards the bottom right of the screen.

The pygame display can actually be initialized in one of several modes. By
default, the display is a basic software driven framebuffer. You can request
special modules like automatic scaling or OpenGL support. These are
controlled by flags passed to ``pygame.display.set_mode()``.

Pygame can only have a single display active at any time. Creating a new one
with ``pygame.display.set_mode()`` will close the previous display. To detect
the number and size of attached screens, you can use
``pygame.display.get_desktop_sizes`` and then select appropriate window size
and display index to pass to ``pygame.display.set_mode()``.

For backward compatibility ``pygame.display`` allows precise control over
the pixel format or display resolutions. This used to be necessary with old
graphics cards and CRT screens, but is usually not needed any more. Use the
functions ``pygame.display.mode_ok()``, ``pygame.display.list_modes()``, and
``pygame.display.Info()`` to query detailed information about the display.

Once the display Surface is created, the functions from this module affect the
single existing display. The Surface becomes invalid if the module is
uninitialized. If a new display mode is set, the existing Surface will
automatically switch to operate on the new display.

When the display mode is set, several events are placed on the pygame event
queue. ``pygame.QUIT`` is sent when the user has requested the program to
shut down. The window will receive ``pygame.ACTIVEEVENT`` events as the display
gains and loses input focus. If the display is set with the
``pygame.RESIZABLE`` flag, ``pygame.VIDEORESIZE`` events will be sent when the
user adjusts the window dimensions. Hardware displays that draw direct to the
screen will get ``pygame.VIDEOEXPOSE`` events when portions of the window must
be redrawn.

A new windowevent API was introduced in pygame 2.0.1. Check event module docs
for more information on that

Some display environments have an option for automatically stretching all
windows. When this option is enabled, this automatic stretching distorts the
appearance of the pygame window. In the pygame examples directory, there is
example code (prevent_display_stretching.py) which shows how to disable this
automatic stretching of the pygame display on Microsoft Windows (Vista or newer
required).

    """Initialize the display module.

    Initializes the pygame display module. The display module cannot do anything
    until it is initialized. This is usually handled for you automatically when
    you call the higher level ``pygame.init()``.

    Pygame will select from one of several internal display backends when it is
    initialized. The display mode will be chosen depending on the platform and
    permissions of current user. Before the display module is initialized the
    environment variable ``SDL_VIDEODRIVER`` can be set to control which backend
    is used. The systems with multiple choices are listed here.

    ::

        Windows : windib, directx
        Unix    : x11, dga, fbcon, directfb, ggi, vgl, svgalib, aalib, wayland

    :note: On wayland desktops, pygame-ce may choose to use the X11 video driver to run on Xwayland.
        This behaviour is determined by the SDL library and might change in the future, so it's suggested
        to account for this and not rely on the default behavior. The Wayland video driver can be forced
        by setting the ``SDL_VIDEODRIVER`` environment variable to ``"wayland"``

    On some platforms it is possible to embed the pygame display into an already
    existing window. To do this, the environment variable ``SDL_WINDOWID`` must
    be set to a string containing the window id or handle. The environment
    variable is checked when the pygame display is initialized. Be aware that
    there can be many strange side effects when running in an embedded display.

    It is harmless to call this more than once, repeated calls have no effect.

    This will create a window or display output and return a display Surface.
    The arguments passed in are requests for a display type. The actual created
    display will be the best possible match supported by the system.

    Note that calling this function implicitly initializes ``pygame.display``, if
    it was not initialized before.

    The size argument is a pair of numbers representing the width and
    height. The flags argument is a collection of additional options. The depth
    argument represents the number of bits to use for color.

    The Surface that gets returned can be drawn to like a regular Surface but
    changes will eventually be seen on the monitor.

    If no size is passed or is set to ``(0, 0)``, the created Surface will have
    the same size as the current screen resolution. If only the width or height
    are set to ``0``, the Surface will have the same width or height as the
    screen resolution.

    Since pygame 2, the depth argument is ignored, in favour of the best
    and fastest one. It also raises a deprecation warning since pygame-ce
    2.4.0 if the passed in depth is not 0 or the one pygame selects.

    When requesting fullscreen display modes, sometimes an exact match for the
    requested size cannot be made. In these situations pygame will select
    the closest compatible match. The returned surface will still always match
    the requested size.

    On high resolution displays(4k, 1080p) and tiny graphics games (640x480)
    show up very small so that they are unplayable. SCALED scales up the window
    for you. The game thinks it's a 640x480 window, but really it can be bigger.
    Mouse events are scaled for you, so your game doesn't need to do it. Note
    that SCALED is considered an experimental API and may change in future
    releases.

    The flags argument controls which type of display you want. There are
    several to choose from, and you can even combine multiple types using the
    bitwise or operator, (the pipe "|" character). Here are the display
    flags you will want to choose from:

    ::

        pygame.FULLSCREEN    create a fullscreen display
        pygame.DOUBLEBUF     only applicable with OPENGL
        pygame.HWSURFACE     (obsolete in pygame 2) hardware accelerated, only in FULLSCREEN
        pygame.OPENGL        create an OpenGL-renderable display
        pygame.RESIZABLE     display window should be sizeable
        pygame.NOFRAME       display window will have no border or controls
        pygame.SCALED        resolution depends on desktop size and scale graphics
        pygame.SHOWN         window is opened in visible mode (default)
        pygame.HIDDEN        window is opened in hidden mode


    .. versionaddedold:: 2.0.0 ``SCALED``, ``SHOWN`` and ``HIDDEN``

    .. versionaddedold:: 2.0.0 ``vsync`` parameter

    By setting the ``vsync`` parameter to ``1``, it is possible to get a display
    with vertical sync at a constant frame rate determined by the monitor and
    graphics drivers. Subsequent calls to :func:`pygame.display.flip()` or
    :func:`pygame.display.update()` will block (i.e. *wait*) until the screen
    has refreshed, in order to prevent "screen tearing"
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing>.

    Be careful when using this feature together with ``pygame.time.Clock`` or
    :func:`pygame.time.delay()`, as multiple forms of waiting and frame rate
    limiting may interact to cause skipped frames.

    The request only works when graphics acceleration is available on the
    system. The exact behaviour depends on the hardware and driver
    configuration. When  ``vsync`` is requested, but unavailable,
    ``set_mode()`` may raise an exception.

    Setting the ``vsync`` parameter to ``-1`` in conjunction with  ``OPENGL``
    will request the OpenGL-specific feature "adaptive vsync" <https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Swap_Interval#Adaptive_Vsync>.

    Here is an example usage of a call
    to ``set_mode()`` that may give you a display with vsync:

    ::

        flags = pygame.OPENGL | pygame.FULLSCREEN
        try:
            window_surface = pygame.display.set_mode((1920, 1080), flags, vsync=1)
            vsync_success=True
        except pygame.error:
            window_surface = pygame.display.set_mode((1920, 1080), flags)
            vsync_success=False

    .. versionaddedold:: 2.0.0 ``vsync`` parameter

    .. versionchanged:: 2.2.0 passing ``vsync`` can raise an exception

    .. versionchanged:: 2.2.0 explicit request for "adaptive vsync"

    .. versionchanged:: 2.2.0 ``vsync=1`` does not require ``SCALED`` or ``OPENGL``

    .. deprecated:: 2.4.0 The depth argument is ignored, and will be set to the optimal value

    .. versionchanged:: 2.5.0 No longer emits warning when running on xwayland, see :func:`pygame.display.init` for details on running on wayland directly

    Basic example:

    ::

        # Open a window on the screen
        screen_width=700
        screen_height=400
        screen=pygame.display.set_mode([screen_width, screen_height])

    The display index ``0`` means the default display is used. If no display
    index argument is provided, the default display can be overridden with an
    environment variable.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.1.3
