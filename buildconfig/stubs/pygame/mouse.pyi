"""Pygame module to work with the mouse.

The mouse functions can be used to get the current state of the mouse device.
These functions can also alter the system cursor for the mouse.

When the display mode is set, the event queue will start receiving mouse
events. The mouse buttons generate ``pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`` and
``pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP`` events when they are pressed and released. These
events contain a button attribute representing which button was pressed. The
mouse wheel will generate ``pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`` and
``pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP`` events when rolled. The button will be set to 4
when the wheel is rolled up, and to button 5 when the wheel is rolled down.
Whenever the mouse is moved it generates a ``pygame.MOUSEMOTION`` event. The
mouse movement is broken into small and accurate motion events. As the mouse
is moving many motion events will be placed on the queue. Mouse motion events
that are not properly cleaned from the event queue are the primary reason the
event queue fills up.

If the mouse cursor is hidden, and input is grabbed to the current display the
mouse will enter a virtual input mode, where the relative movements of the
mouse will never be stopped by the borders of the screen. See the functions
``pygame.mouse.set_visible()`` and ``pygame.event.set_grab()`` to get this
configured.

**Mouse Wheel Behavior in pygame 2**

There is proper functionality for mouse wheel behaviour with pygame 2 supporting
``pygame.MOUSEWHEEL`` events.  The new events support horizontal and vertical
scroll movements, with signed integer values representing the amount scrolled
(``x`` and ``y``), as well as ``flipped`` direction (the set positive and
negative values for each axis is flipped). Read more about SDL2
input-related changes here `<https://wiki.libsdl.org/MigrationGuide#input>`_

In pygame 2, the mouse wheel functionality can be used by listening for the
``pygame.MOUSEWHEEL`` type of an event (Bear in mind they still emit
``pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`` events like in pygame 1.x, as well).
When this event is triggered, a developer can access the appropriate ``Event`` object
with ``pygame.event.get()``. The object can be used to access data about the mouse
scroll, such as ``which`` (it will tell you what exact mouse device trigger the event).

    """Get the state of the mouse buttons.

    Returns a sequence of booleans representing the state of all the mouse
    buttons. A true value means the mouse is currently being pressed at the time
    of the call.

    To get all of the mouse events it is better to use either
    ``pygame.event.wait()`` or ``pygame.event.get()`` and check all of those
    events to see if they are ``MOUSEBUTTONDOWN``, ``MOUSEBUTTONUP``, or
    ``MOUSEMOTION``. Remember to call ``pygame.event.get()`` or ``pygame.event.pump()``
    before this function, otherwise it will not work as expected.

    To support five button mice, an optional parameter ``num_buttons`` has been
    added in pygame 2. When this is set to ``5``, ``button4`` and ``button5``
    are added to the returned tuple. Only ``3`` and ``5`` are valid values
    for this parameter.

    If the ``desktop`` argument is ``True`` the mouse state will be correct even
    if the window has no focus. In addition since it queries the OS it does not depend
    on the last event pump while being slightly slower.

    .. note:: On ``X11`` some X servers use middle button emulation. When you
       click both buttons ``1`` and ``3`` at the same time a ``2`` button event
       can be emitted.

       mouse state on Wayland. The normal mouse state is returned instead.
