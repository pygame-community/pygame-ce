class Window:
    """Pygame object that represents a window.

    The Window class (formerly known as _sdl2.video.Window), is a newly
    published feature of pygame-ce 2.5.2. This class allows for programs
    to drive multiple windows on-screen at once, something not possible with
    the :func:`pygame.display.set_mode` API. Not everything possible with
    :mod:`pygame.display` is possible yet in the Window API, but the new
    window class will continue to be developed, and we're excited to share
    the new functionality this class offers.

    :param str title: The title of the window.
    :param (int, int) size: The size of the window, in screen coordinates.
    :param (int, int) or int position: A tuple specifying the window position, or
                                        ``WINDOWPOS_CENTERED``, or ``WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED``.
    :param bool fullscreen: Create a fullscreen window using the window size as
                            the resolution (videomode change).
    :param bool fullscreen_desktop: Create a fullscreen window using the current
                                    desktop resolution.
    :param bool opengl: Create a window with support for an OpenGL context.
    :param bool vulkan: Create a window with support for a Vulkan instance.
    :param bool hidden: Create a hidden window.
    :param bool borderless: Create a window without borders.
    :param bool resizable: Create a resizable window.
    :param bool minimized: Create a mimized window.
    :param bool maximized: Create a maximized window.
    :param bool mouse_grabbed: Create a window with grabbed mouse input.
    :param bool keyboard_grabbed: Create a window with grabbed keyboard input.
    :param bool input_focus: Create a window with input focus.
    :param bool mouse_focus: Create a window with mouse focus.
    :param bool allow_high_dpi: Create a window in high-DPI mode if supported.
    :param bool mouse_capture: Create a window that has the mouse captured
                                (unrelated to INPUT_GRABBED).
    :param bool always_on_top: Create a window that is always presented above
                                others.
    :param bool utility: Create a window that doesn't appear in the task bar.

    Event behavior if one Window is created: When the close button is pressed,
    the ``QUIT`` event will be sent to the event queue.

    .. code-block:: python

        import pygame

        window = pygame.Window()

        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                raise SystemExit

    Event behavior if multiple windows are created: When the close button is
    pressed, a ``WINDOWCLOSE`` event is sent. You need to explicitly destroy
    the window. Note that the event ``QUIT`` will only be sent if all
    windows have been destroyed.

    .. code-block:: python

        import pygame

        window1 = pygame.Window(position=(0,100))
        window2 = pygame.Window(position=(700,100))

        while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.WINDOWCLOSE:
                id = event.window.id
                print(f"WINDOWCLOSE event sent to Window #{id}.")
                event.window.destroy()

            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                print(f"Last window is destroyed. QUIT event was sent.")
                pygame.quit()
