# This is a hack because I'm lazy :)
# libdecor depends on cairo which is a kinda heavy dependency and need more
# scripting work. But libdecor shared lib is not actually present in the
# manylinux wheel and is dynamically loaded by SDL at runtime (if available on
# users system)
# So we override the plugin builds to skip cairo (and only build dummy plugin)
