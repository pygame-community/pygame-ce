# freetype and harfbuzz have an infamous circular dependency, which is why

# 1. First compile freetype without harfbuzz support
cd $FREETYPE

./configure $PG_BASE_CONFIGURE_FLAGS --with-harfbuzz=no
make
make install  # this freetype is not installed to mac cache dir

cd ..

# 2. Compile harfbuzz with freetype support
cd ${HARFBUZZ_NAME}

# harfbuzz has a load of optional dependencies but only freetype is important
# to us.
# Cairo and chafa are only needed for harfbuzz commandline utilities so we
# don't use it. glib available is a bit old so we don't prefer it as of now.
# we also don't compile-in icu so that harfbuzz uses built-in unicode handling

    # lie that harfbuzz doesn't depend on freetype (even though it does).
    # This ensures no direct circular dylib link happen.
    # This is a bit of a brittle hack: This command removes the entire line that
    # contains "freetype". This is fine for now when the harfbuzz we are
    # building has no other dependencies
